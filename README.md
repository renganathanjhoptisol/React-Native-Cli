# Animations 

	-> Animations are very important to create a great user experience. Stationary objects
must overcome inertia as they moving. Objects in motion have momentum and rarely come to a stop immediately.
Animations allow you to convey physically believable motion in your interface.

	-> React Native provides two complementary animation systems. 

		1. Animated for granular and interactive control of specific values
		2. LayoutAnimation for animated global layout transactions.

# Animated API

	-> The Animated API is designed to concisely express a wide variety of interesting
animation and interaction patterns in a very performant way. Animated focuses on declarative relationships
between inputs and outputs, with configurable transforms in between and start/stop methods to control time-based animation execution.

	-> Animated exports six animatable component types : 
		
		1. View
		2. Text
		3. Image
		4. ScrollView
		5. FlatList
		6. SectionList
	
	-> You can also create your own using Animated.createAnimatedComponent().

# Configuring animations

	-> Animations are heavily configurable. Custom and predefined easing functions, delays, durations, decay factors, spring constants, and more can all be tweaked depending on the type of animation.

	-> Animated provides several animation types, the most commonly used one being Animated.timing(). 

	-> It supports animating a value over time using one of various predefined easing functions, or you can use your owen.

	-> Easing functions are typically used in animation to convey gradual acceleration and deceleration of objects.
